# auto-analyze-javaparser
  This is a static program analysis project, which mainly makes use of the JavaParser tool.  
  The entire compressed folder contains 4 sub-files. Among them, the two sub-folders, commons-cli and commons-math, are the two Java project objects that need to be analyzed. The PDF file is the corresponding program analysis experimental report, and Analyze0510 contains the main analysis code.  
  The eight CSV files in the folder contain the complete results of the program analysis. Meanwhile, eight Java source files are included in the project, where the ClassInterfaceExtractor file corresponds to Task 1, the MethodStatistics file corresponds to Task 2, the DependencyAnalysis and DependencyAnalysis_tu files correspond to Task 3, and the CodeMetrics, CodeTotal, and CodeCircle files correspond to Task 4. Detailed implementation specifications are documented as comments within the respective source files. The main file contains introductory test cases for JavaParser and is not directly related to the project tasks.
